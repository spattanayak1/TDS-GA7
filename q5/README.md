**Author:** 24f2001293@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

## Business Context
A major retail client required a professional, publication-ready visualization showing the distribution of purchase amounts across different customer segments.  
This visualization supports their quarterly business review, helping executives and the board make data-driven strategic decisions about customer spending behavior.

## Methodology
- **Tool:** Python with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- **Chart Type:** Boxplot
- **Data:** Realistic synthetic purchase data for three segments:
  - High Value
  - Medium Value
  - Low Value
- **Visualization Goals:**
  - Compare spending patterns across segments
  - Highlight medians, variability, and potential outliers
  - Deliver presentation-ready visuals for business use

## Visualization
The chart `chart.png` is **exactly 512Ã—512 pixels**, styled with Seaborn's professional whitegrid theme and Set2 palette.  
It features clear axis labels, a descriptive title, and a clean layout for use in executive presentations and board reports.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install seaborn matplotlib pandas numpy
